# Multi-trait-Genome-Prediction
The project objectives include the prediction of wheat phenotypic traits, the reduction of a vast dataset of 14,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to a more manageable 24 SNPs through correlation analysis, and the application of state-of-the-art machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (Feedforward Neural Network) algorithms.
